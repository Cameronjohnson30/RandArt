## Name of Student: Cameron Johnson

## Name of Project: RandArt

## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
RandArt will allow users to build a library of art ideas and have it generate a random idea based on the library built.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Have users build lists of categories and ideas.
* Provide a random output based on the the library built.

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* _Ruby_ 
* _Rails_ 
* _RSPEC_
* _Capybara_
* _shoulda-matchers_
* _Pry_
* _Postgres_
* _SQL_
* _Devise_
* _CSS_ 
* _JavaScript_

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* Users sign up and make a profile 
* Allow users to post their artwork on a wall
* Allow users to post comments and likes
* Api call for a random idea
* React for the front end

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* Ruby gems
* Build the data base for a user  
* Api 
* React 

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know? 
* Once I finish my MVP and most my stretch goals I want to talk to a website that runs an AI to create an art piece based on user inputs and see if I can link their page on mine. That way users can use the AI piece to try and mimic.
